# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on PyBer ride trends in urban, suburban and rural cities. Data was collected from 2,375 rides in 120 cities from January to May 2019. This report draws on data analysis to make recommendations on addressing disparities among city types. 

## Results
**Summary of Data**
![Summary](/analysis/SummaryDF.jpg)
The table above shows the data disaggregated by city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. While the average fare per ride ranges from $24.53 to $34.62, differing by $10, the average fare per driver is $16.57 for urban cities and $55.49 in rural cities, a difference of almost $39. The rural average fare per drive is almost four times the rural average. This difference could be due to the number of drivers in service in each city. The following calculation was used to find the average number of drivers per city per city type.

On average, there are nines times more drivers available in urban cities than there are in rural cities.
